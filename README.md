# music-store-database

### This is a project for SBD course at PJAIT.

A database for a music store with records. We are able to store information about albums, such as their title, release date, music genres, songs (and individual authors of these songs stored in the Artist table, used in case of collaborations between artists), artists who are authors of albums. We assume that artists are authors of albums only in the case of "assigning" them to albums (which means that if band A is the author of the album, but one song from this album has an author A and B, then the author of the album is still A, it's just that that song has two artists). The database also allows an album to have many songs and artists at the same time (thanks to the use of associative tables). So we can store albums belonging to e.g. two different authors at the same time. 

Database also has tables for the ordering system, thanks to which customers can order albums. They can order one or many albums, or even several of the same records (Quantity column in OrderDetails) in one order. In the Price column, we store the total price for the same albums and their quantity (i.e. album price * Quantity for this album in the order). In the Stock table, we store information about the quantity of available goods (individual albums) in the warehouse and their current price. We also have access to the history of album prices through the Price_form and Price_to columns, which store the date range of a specific price (timestamps). The Order table stores the order identifier along with its date and the id of the customer who placed it. We also store basic information about customers in the Customer table, such as name, surname, email, phone number and address. Tables (except associative ones) support auto-incrementing (IDENTITY(1,1) for T-SQL and GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY for PL/SQL).

This repository contains 2 `.sql` scripts for both T-sql and pl/sql. `drop-create-insert-select.sql` has drops, create tables, data insertions and selections. `procedures-triggers.sql` is much more interesting, as it contains script for useful procedures and triggers which are different for each sql dialect. Comment before every command explains what it does and how it works.
